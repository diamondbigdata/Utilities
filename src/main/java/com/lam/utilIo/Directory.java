 * Problem from: http://www.zsoltfabok.com/
 * 
 * Implement an application which follows the iterator design
 *         pattern. This particular application receives a directory as
 *         argument, and at each consecutive call, it returns a file name from
 *         the directory that hasnâ€™t been returned before, in a random order.
 *         When the application reaches the end of the content of the directory,
 *         it shall start over, again returning the directory contents in a
 *         random order. If the directory is empty, then every call shall return
 *         an empty string. **If the argument is not a directory but a file,
 *         then its name shall be returned on each consecutive call.
 *
